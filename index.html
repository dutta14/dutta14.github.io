                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    Hi there! If you've reached here you probably know something about me. You've read my resume, and would like to know more about the work I do. Great! Let's get started.<br><br>

                    I am Anindya Dutta, a MS in CS student at the University of Southern California. I like to work on anything and everything, from web development to mobile development, software development to AI, from search algorithms to spam classifiers using Machine Learning, I have tried my hands at anything that sparks my interest. However, if I were to choose one area of interest that I consider myself an expert at, it would be Android development. So hit me up if you would like to get an Android app built for yourself! Send me an e-mail and we can discuss more.<br><br>


                    I am a passionate developer and love to make software from scratch and see it to the end. That said, I have also worked on huge codebases, like Samsung's Android codebase, trying to fix bugs here and there, develop  new features, and get an ongoing patent on my name. Through various internships, I have built my teamwork and leadership skills. I am not a fresher per se, I have had two years of work experience as a full-time engineer at Samsung R&amp;D, and over ten months of internship experience at four organizations. You can find all these details on my resume.<br><br>

                    When I am not working, I read. I like fiction, and my favorite book is 'The Fountainhead' by Ayn Rand. I am also available on Goodreads, so if you are a bookworm, I would be happy to connect with you.<br><br>

                    Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you found what you were looking for. In case you want more details about a project that I have been working on, please send me an e-mail and I will get back to you within twenty-four hours.

                                As an engineer, I always looked out for opportunities to build something which never existed before. This opportunity came in the form of 'Smart notifier'. <i>Smart notifier</i> is a feature that helps the user to categorize notifications into several groups based on priority, and type of the notification (e.g, critical notifications, communication, social networking, unimportant notifications etc). The user can then use a new tabbed view in the notification panel to see only those notifications that he wishes to.<br>
                                This also allows the user to mute a group for certain time periods, so that the notifications from a certain set of apps do not disturb him in that interval. The user can choose the apps for each category in the settings.<br><br>

My area of expertise was <i>Network Controller</i>. This module was responsible for showing the correct icons on the status bar and quick panel based on values that were sent by the <i>RIL communication layer.</i>

I was also responsible to clean up code for mass devices that had a far less number of features but were using the same code as flagship models.<br><br>

                                For my university end-semester mini-project, I developed an Android application with Samsung R&amp;D which uses location-based APIs to track where a contact had last updated their location. This was achieved by making a server and storing the last known locations of all users of the app, and then periodically, the app required to push the current location to the server. When a user wished to see the location of any contact, based on whether he had permissions or not, we send him the last known location of a particular contact. This app was built to learn the intricacies of location-based systems, how <i>coarse locations</i> varied from <i>fine locations</i>, and also used socket programming to connect clients to the server.<br><br>

                                <li><b>Product Feature Extractor</b></li>
                                I wrote a Java program which could be called using a batch script to download all the product feature files from a repository and separate the product features of one file into several files based on the modules for which the features were implemented. Thus a device had one feature file with all feature properties, and my responsibility was to take many such files and compare module features between different models.

                            I was selected as an exchange student for the University, and worked with <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Hayo_Siemsen" target="_blank">Professor Karl Hayo Siemsen</a>. My field of work was knowledge-based expert systems. I worked on two projects.
                            <ul>
                            <li><b>Expert system</b></li>
                            I built my first Android application to simulate an expert system. It had a knowledge base inputted to it, which was a map of diseases to its symptoms. Using inference algorithm, I then had to diagnose diseases based on a set of input symptoms. Though the knowledge base that I used was pretty small, the application is generic, and can be used for almost any knowledge base, as long as it can be converted to CNF.<br><br>

The motive of this app was to use existing libraries that could already plot figures given a set of points and include it in our project to enhance existing features such as arithmetic functions on rational functions. <a href="https://github.com/dutta14/RationalFunctions" target="_blank"> Here is the code on GitHub. </a>
